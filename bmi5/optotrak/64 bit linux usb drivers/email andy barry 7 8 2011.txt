Hi Melanie,

Sure, no worries.  The README file explains how to install the driver
and also how to build it from source.  Someone knowledgeable with
Linux shouldn't have too much trouble.


My full kernel string is:

abarry@AAAZZZ:~$ uname -a
Linux AAAZZZ 2.6.32-32-generic #62-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 20 21:52:38 UTC
2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux

so the short answer is I'm running it on 2.6.32-32.  I've included
64-bit and 32-bit binaries, so both should work.


Let me know if you have any trouble with it.


Best,

Andy

---- tlh's notes: 
(1) Need ftdi's drivers, http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
(now included in the repository). 
they are supplied as binaries, pretty simple to install. 

(2) Install NDI's oapi. 
cd optotrak/NDIoapi/ndlib/lib
sudo cp liboapi.so /usr/local/lib
sudo ldconfig

(3) sudo apt-get install libusb-dev (not libusb-1.0-0-dev)

(4) build usblink.so -- will be copied to /usr/local/lib. 

(5) copy NDoapi to /opt/

(6) export ND_DIR="/opt/NDIoapi/ndigital"
	and add it to your ~/.bashrc
	
(7) libftdi2xx requires glib version 2.14 -- but debian has version 2.13-37. 
	Therefore we need to install eglibc version 2.14 (testing this..)
	i've installed it to /opt/eglibc/
	You'll need to make /opt/eglibc/etc/ld.so.conf with the line
	/opt/eglibc/lib
	then make install.
