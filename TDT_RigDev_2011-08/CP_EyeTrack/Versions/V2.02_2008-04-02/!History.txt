CP_EyeTrack history

Version 2.02 2008-03-27
  - Changed SAFEARRAYs to VARIANTs (containing SAFEARRAYS). 
    Replaced SafeArrayLib.cpp with VariantLib.cpp

  - Added GetFrameCount( long * pnFrames ) method. This will help to catch 
    possible dissynchronization between the tracker and the external counter (RP2).

Version 2.01 2007-10-08
  - Masked for lower 4 bits of the counter coming from IScan. 
    Unused 4 bits were creating errors when digital input on 
	IScan was configured to more than 4 bits 

  - Added printing of the final frame count on DisconnectTracker()

  - Added mutex to insure a single instance of the application

  - Added a checkmark to show/hide the log window

  - Changed reset frame counter to output 2 reset pulses
