CP_LibertyTrack history

Ver 0.04 2008-02-21
  - Added GetFrameCount( long * pnFrames ) method. This will help to catch 
    possible dissynchronization between the tracker and the external counter (RP2).
  - Changed data collection startup procedure, now OnDataStart event is used. 
    Hopefully this will resolve issues with Liberty startup (wrong frame count)

Ver 0.03 2007-10-08
  - Added frame print to the GUI window
  - Added fix for spurious marked frame with high index (never happened in the tests, 
    could have been due to bad WindowProc() which I fixed, see below)
  - Fixed SetSensorsTransformIdx, which complained on valid input. 
    It was due to an error in SafeArrayLib
  - Changed message handling routine to be DialogProc, not WindowProc
