  - Added frame print to the GUI window
  - Added fix for spurious marked frame with high index (never happened in the tests, 
    could have been due to bad WindowProc() which I fixed, see below)
  - Fixed SetSensorsTransformIdx, which complained on valid input. 
    It was due to an error in SafeArrayLib
  - Changed message handling routine to be DialogProc, not WindowProc
