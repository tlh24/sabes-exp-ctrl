-- Check server state before changing the parameters (add check function). 
   Return error if the state is not Idle. 
-- Check system performance with many channels (RX5 only)
-- Check all Examples in new location (relative path to tanks?)
-- Publish on the Web, add install/test/use instructions
-- Client time-out? Check: Count number of DCOM clients. (See old code for CP_DAQ)
-- Add state info to the main window of CP_TDT
-- Make sure that a single instance is running.
-- Document (snapshot) and publish DCOM permissions
-- Add error checking in the DCOM wrapper (disallow changes in recording and armed state)
-- Restore Version 0.02 from the backup to the versions directory (Chiara was using it for a while)

DONE:
-----
-- !!! Change Buffer size in all examples to 40000
-- !!! Add Enable to iTime counter in all RPXes
-- !!! Bug: CP_TDT_Stream is longer than the tank. 
-- !!! Make sure all available points are saved when going from Record to Preview
-- in the log output: "Timer Started" - change to "Timer enabled"
-- In the log output: "Connect Server" add server name 
-- Hide Test button
-- Add muti-channel example
-- Make ConvertToInt16 example (and test)
-- Add tank example, use to debug the 1-point issue
-- Rounding-off in the sample count. Shift by 1 tick
-- Add conversion to ints option to the DCOM interface
-- Figure out permissions for XP SP2 allowing to launch with desktop interaction
-- !!! remove BLOCK_DATA_SIZE_FACTOR from the cpp code, add iSampleCount to the RCX file, 
   do rate scaling in the firmware
