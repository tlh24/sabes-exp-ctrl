CP_TimeSync history


Ver 0.01 2008-07-08
  - Added ConnectRX5() method, we want to use RX5-2 in TimeSync

Ver 1.00 2011-08-15
  - Added a compile-time option to run with OpenDev / OpenWorkbench

Ver 1.01 2011-08-16
  - Made option to run with OpenDev / OpenWorkbench runtime
    RPcoX / TDevAccX clients are new created when the Connect call is 
    made (see point 1 below).

  Changes from ActiveX-only Version:
  
1. Connection determines run-mode:  
   Which mode you run in is determined by how you connect.
   If you use "ConnectRX5" or "ConnectRP2", you will be 'ActiveX' mode,
   and the code should run just as in Ver 0.01.
   If you use "ConnectServer", which requires an argument giving the servers' 
   name, then you will be in 'OpenDev' mode.

2. For OpenDev: Run/Halt put the Devices/Workbench into Record/Ilde states, respectively

3. Two commands are device-specific with OpenDev:
   GetStatus(long *) should be replaced with GetDeviceStatus(BSTR deviceName, long *) and GetSysMode(long *)
   GetSFreq(float *) should be replaced with GetDeviceSFreq(BSTR deviceName, float *)
   Here, deviceName is the string used for the device in OpenWorkbench
   
4. Several other functions not defined for OpenDev mode:

    HRESULT ClearCOF([out, retval] long * piResult );

    HRESULT LoadCOF([in] BSTR bstFileName,
                    [out, retval] long * piResult );

    HRESULT ReadCOF([in] BSTR bstFileName,
                    [out, retval] long * piResult );

    HRESULT SoftTrg([in] long iBitIdx,
                    [out, retval] long * piResult );

    HRESULT ReadTagVEX( [in]  BSTR bstTag, 
                        [in] long iStartIdx, 
                        [in] long nItems, 
                        [in] BSTR bstSrcType, 
                        [in] BSTR bstDstType, 
                        [in] long nChans, 
                        [out, retval] VARIANT * pvArray );
